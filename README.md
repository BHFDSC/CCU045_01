# Specialist care for acute heart failure during and after the COVID-19 pandemic

## Project description

The COVID pandemic disrupted the delivery of care for patients with heart failure (HF), leading to fewer hospitalisations and increased mortality. However, nationwide data on quality of care and long-term outcomes across the pandemic are scarce. 

We used data from England to investigate secondary care management and outcomes for patients with HF before, during and after the pandemic.
